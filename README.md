# MungBot
Discord chat bot that replies with user info, server info, or a randomly selected nickname for my friend Cian.

# About MungBot
This is a simple, local program that runs from the command line using Node.js.
I wrote it in JavaScript using the Discord.js module. Data is stored in JSON files.

After finals are over, I intend to add the following features:
1. Generate new names using learned criteria 2. Validate and add names to its list from user inputs

At present, you can use:
1. /summon for a random Cian nickname 2. /user for your Discord user info 3. /server for info on whatever server you're using

Thanks for looking, and enjoy!
